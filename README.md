This is a repo with a very brief look at some wave data from the North Shore!  The analysis can be found in the wavedata_analysis.ipynb.  If you want to run the notebook, the conda environment can be recreated using the environment.yml.  The datasets using in this analysis are buoy_all.dat and oahu_all.dat.

Thanks for checking it out!
